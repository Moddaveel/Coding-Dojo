// Question 1: Write a function that prints all integers from 1 to 255
function Print1to255(){
    // Your code here
    }
    
    // Question 2: Write a function that prints all ODD integers from 1 to 255
    function PrintOdds(){
    // Your code here
    }
    
    // Question 3: Take your code from Print1to255 and add a sum variable to it. Now as you print each number, also print out the sum of all the numbers so far
    function PrintSum(){
    // Your code here
    }
    
    // Question 4: Write a function that, given an array, will print each value one at a time to the console
    function PrintArray(arr){
    // Your code here
    }
    
    // Question 5: Now that you know how to loop through an array, write a function that finds the largest value in any given array and prints it to the console
    function FindAndPrintMax(arr){
    // Your code here
    }
    
    // Question 6: Same question from 5 but in reverse. Can you find the smallest value in any given array and print it to the console?
    function FindAndPrintMin(arr){
    // Your code here
    }
    
    // Question 7: Remember how you figured out the sum of 1 to 255? Take that logic and get me the sum of all the values from a given array. Print the answer to the console
    function PrintSumOfArray(arr){
    // Your code here
    }
    
    // Question 8: You found the sum of the values of a given array. Now what can you add to your code to find the average of those values?
    function PrintAverage(arr){
    // Your code here
    }
    
    // Question 9: Write a function that returns an array with all the original values squared (ex: given array [1,2,3,4] you should get back [1,4,9,16])
    function SquareValues(arr){
    // Your code here
    }
    
    // Question 10: Write a function that, given an array, returns that array after setting any negative numbers in the array to 0. (ex: given [1,-2,3,-4] return [1,0,3,0])
    function ZeroOutNegatives(arr){
    // Your code here
    }
    
    // Question 11: You've done all these things one at a time. Now write a function that does them all in one go. Write a function that, given an array, prints out the smallest value, the largest value, and the average of all the values
    function PrintMinMaxAndAverage(arr){
    // Your code here
    } 
    
    // Can you see now how the basics pile on top of each other to form more complex answers? This is the root of all algorithm/problem solving. Every question can be broken down into these basic pieces you know how to do. What you need to do is identify that those basic pieces are there, and then solving algorithms gets a lot easier.
